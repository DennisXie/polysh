Group Shell
~~~~~~~~~~~

Group Shell (also called gsh) is a remote shell multiplexor. It lets you control
many remote shells at once in a single shell. Unlike other commands dispatchers,
it is interactive, so shells spawned on the remote hosts are persistent. It
requires only a SSH server on the remote hosts, or some other way to open a
remote shell.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python >= 2.4 is required.

Running
~~~~~~~

You can run gsh without installing it simply by executing the gsh.py file in the
toplevel gsh directory.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gsh uses the distutils, so the command './setup.py install' will install it
in the default python directory. It should also install the gsh script in
/usr/local/bin.
